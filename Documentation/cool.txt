Extremely Interesting Ideas (EII) (tm ;)

Warning, You Have Been WarNed.

...When Bad Comes to Worse, and you need to **reset** your peripheral brain...:
...ie loose everything...
...and remember 2nd-left-right-on does wonders with a TI-89...
...likewise, 2nd-hand-on does wonders with a TI-92Plus or V200...


***EII #1:
Change the Logical Screen Height:
Jump To Address 0h600013
Edit Size=BYTE
Mask=NONE
Value = 256-x (default: x=128 lines tall)
Any value from 256-0 through 256-256 is valid. On the TI-92p/V200 you might experiment with 256-112
or 256-84 on the TI-89. Be careful! Small x values result in extremely dark contrast settings while
large x values result in extremely light contrast settings (the contrast side-effect is a direct 
relationship with the refresh rate). Neat, Huh?


***EII #2:
Disable Auto Power On (Link Cable)
Type bclr(0h60000c,7) on the home screen entry line
After you do this, the calculator will not turn on when you insert a link cable into the i/o port

***EII #3:
Enable Auto Power On (Link Cable)
To Restore normal operation after using EII #2(insert cable, calculator turns on) try this:
Type bset(0h60000c,7) on the home screen entry line

After you do this, the calculator will turn on when you instet a link cable into the i/o port

***EII #4:
Make Your calculator do some things Fast, Normal, Slow, or Slower!
This affects Auto Interrupts 1,5 and _Possibly_ Auto Interrupt 3 on HW1 calcs (i should check this).
 Auto Interrupt 3 is not changed on HW2 models.

Fast:				Type bclr(0h600015,5):bclr(0h600015,4) on the home screen entry line
Normal (Default):	Type bclr(0h600015,5):bset(0h600015,4) on the home screen entry line
Slower:				Type bset(0h600015,5):bclr(0h600015,4) on the home screen entry line
Slowest:			Type bset(0h600015,5):bset(0h600015,4) on the home screen entry line


***EII #5:
Hide A Variable (Method #1 Change the First letter)
Use the Var-Link From Within Command Post to select the variable you wish to hide
Press ENTER, and Choose "Sym Entry"
Change the first BYTE to any number from 0h00 to 0h40

***EII #6:
Hide A Variable (Method #2 Set the In-Use Bit)
Use the Var-Link From Within Command Post to select the variable you wish to hide
Press ENTER, and Choose "Sym Entry"
Press DIAMOND, Down, Left, Left, Left, Left
Bring up the EDIT dialog, set the mask to OR and type the value 0h10

to undo this operation, you must make sure that you are editing the SYM_ENTRY of
the varible you wish to unhide. Next Use the edit dialog (with the cursor at the
same location in the SYM_ENTRY struct as before) change the mask to AND, and type the value
"not 0h10" without the quotation marks into the value field


***EII #7:
Speaking of strings, take the RedPillNeo
Software that calls itself a hardware patch is quite helpful.

***EII #8:
Its All About Shift + g
