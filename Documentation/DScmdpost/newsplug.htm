<p>Merry Belated Christmas Everyone!</p>
<p>Having survived four months of beta testing, the long awaited Command
  Post update has arrived: <a href="/cmdpost">Command
Post Plus</a>! </p>
<p>This version contains updated tools which are designed to aid
  developers in the creation bug free applications for the TI-89, TI-92 Plus,
  and Voyage 200 handhelds. Along with the original features such as <a href="/cmdpost/f_three.htm#LeakWatch">Leak
  Watch</a> and
  the <a href="/cmdpost/quickstart.htm">Hex Editor</a>, you will find many
  new features including:
  A full featured <a href="/cmdpost/disassembler.htm">disassembler</a> which
  is able to identify rom calls and error messages. A much improved crash detection
  system (called <a href="/cmdpost/crash_guard.htm">Crash Guard</a>) which allows
  developers to jump to the disassembly of flawed code which caused a crash.
   Command Post Plus can also be used
  with Greg's <a href="http://calc.gregd.org/download.php?explain=1&what=superstart" target="_blank">Super
  Start</a> flash application to make monitoring ASM programs & games for memory
  leaks
  a breeze! Other features and updates include link port logging, more <a href="/cmdpost/tibasic.htm">TI-BASIC
  extensions</a> and
  enhanced <a href="/cmdpost/f_two.htm#Find">search
  features</a>!
   Command Post also sports a <a href="/cmdpost/extensibility.htm">special
  library
  interface</a> which allows other programs to use Command Post features including <a href="/cmdpost/extensibility.htm#LeakWatch_Begin">Leak
  Watch</a>, and on-demand <a href="/cmdpost/extensibility.htm#Disassemble_One">Disassembly</a> of
  ASM code.</p>
